# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.
#
# The following environments are defined:
#
# - Python 3.8 to 3.10 with dependency sets:
#   - minimal
#   - recommended
#   - full
#
# The following dependency sets are defined, which specify the "extras_require" section to choose when installing
# via setup.py:
#
#  - minimal: no additional extras
