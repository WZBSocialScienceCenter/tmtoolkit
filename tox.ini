# tox (https://tox.readthedocs.io/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.
#
# The following environments are defined:
#
# - Python 3.6 and 3.7 with dependency sets:
#   - minimal
#   - recommended
#   - recommended-datatable
#   - full
#   - full-datatable
#
# - Python 3.8 with dependency sets (because datatable is not available on Python 3.8):
#   - minimal
#   - recommended
#   - full38
#
# The following dependency sets are defined, which specify the "extras_require" section to choose when installing
# via setup.py:
#
#  - minimal: no additional extras
#  - recommended: excel_export and wordcloud
#  - full: recommended and all topic modeling packages (lda, scikit-learn, gensim)
#  - full38: recommended and topic modeling packages scikit-learn and gensim (lda so far cannot be installed on 3.8)
#
#  The additional suffix "-datatable" also installs datatable.
