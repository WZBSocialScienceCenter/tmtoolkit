        'NewsArticles-1': 'Disney Parks Just Got More Expensive As Ticket Prices Rise Again\n\nA single day in a Disney park can cost as much as $124.\n\nA Disney vacation just got a little more expensive.- The company announced over the weekend that prices at its theme parks in Florida and Anaheim will increase, along with the costs of some annual passes. Under the company\'s tiered admission system introduced last year, prices vary based on the day.- At the Magic Kingdom-in Walt Disney World, a single-day ticket will cost-$107 for adults or $101 for children on the cheapest "value" days, an increase of $2, according to Fox 5 in Orlando.- A "regular" ticket will jump $5, to $115 for adults and $109 for children.- "Peak" days will remain unchanged at $124 for adults and $118 for kids.- The other three theme parks in Florida have slightly lower prices at $99/$107/$119 for adults and $93/$101/$113 for kids, increases of between $2 and $5. In Anaheim, prices for a single day at Disneyland-or its sister park, Disney California Adventure,-will cost $97/$110/$124 for adults and $91/$104/$118 for children, increases of between $2 and $5. MousePlanet has a breakdown on many of the Disneyland ticket options and how much they\'re increased. The Orange County Register also lists all-price increases since 2000, when a Disneyland ticket cost just $41, or $57.14 in 2016 dollars according to the CPI inflation calculator. Discounts are available for multiple-day admissions, but the company will now offer a $20 discount on such tickets purchased online or by phone in advance, the Orlando Sentinel said.-- The prices of some annual passes at both resorts will also increase along with most parking fees.- Disney\'s earnings report last week showed lower net income and revenues, falling short of analysts" expectations, Deadline reported. Year-over-year attendance in theme parks for the last quarter fell by 5 percent, the Orlando Sentinel said, in part because Hurricane Matthew closed the Florida parks for a day and a half in October. However, despite the lower attendance, revenue and income in the theme parks division-increased, according to Forbes.- Motley Fool analyst Rick Munarriz noted in his column that price increases in the parks may have helped to lower guest counts at the company\'s famously crowded parks, with lower attendance in three of the past four quarters, while increasing revenue and profit.- "Disney will come out of this just fine," he predicted. "Disney is making more with less, and as long as revenue and operating income keep inching higher, don"t expect the media giant to ease back on the annual increases." The jump in prices comes just days after the company announced that "Pandora: The World Of Avatar," the land at Disney\'s Animal Kingdom in Florida,-will open on May 27. Lands themed to "Star Wars" will open at Disneyland in Anaheim and Disney\'s Hollywood Studios in Florida in 2019, the company said.-',
        'NewsArticles-2': 'Sikh Temples Open Their Doors To Oroville Dam Evacuees\n\n"We\'r well prepared."\n\nMore than 180,000 people in Northern California were ordered to evacuate-late on Sunday due to erosion of the emergency spillway in the nation\'s tallest dam. Several Sikh temples in the area opened their doors to people in need of places to spend the night. Earlier in the evening, California\'s Department of Water Resources said the Oroville Dam\'s emergency spillway, which prevents water from rushing over the top of the dam when levels are high, was in danger of failing and sending an "uncontrolled release of flood waters from Lake Oroville." .@CA_DWR update on #OrovilleSpillway pic.twitter.com/xzGp6xxyR6 Thousands of residents from counties including Yuba, Butte and Sutter were told to leave their homes immediately. Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg tweeted that individuals evacuating the Yuba county area could seek shelter in at least seven local Sikh houses of worship in the area. Sacramento is about an hour and a half south of Oroville Dam. Sikh Temples in Sacramento region are open for people evacuated around #OrovilleDam. Am told they have food ready & all in need are welcome. pic.twitter.com/Vz2jYEte2w "We\'r well prepared," Dr. Gurtej S. Cheema of Sacramento\'s Capital Sikh Center told the Huffington Post. The gurudwara is one of the closest for residents leaving Yuba City. "We have meals, shelter. We can accommodate at least 50 people here." Cheema said that after evacuation orders were announced, members of the gurudwara delivered enough bedding for 50 people to spend the night at the temple. They also prepared hot tea and meals for evacuees to eat once they arrive. "We have three families over here right now, and we\'r expecting at least 10 more [to spend the night]," Cheema added. Overall, he said the temple had received 30 calls from individuals saying they were on their way, fighting gridlocked traffic in the area.-- "We\'r glad we can help and are available," he added. Yuba City\'s first Sikh temple was built in 1969, though the community\'s roots in the area date back decades before.-In November, Yuba City was home to the biggest Sikh event outside India, the Sacramento Bee reported.-Tens of thousands of individuals gathered at the 37th annual Sikh Parade Festival to honor the teachings of Sikhism\'s founder and celebrate the Sikh pioneers who came to Yuba City 110 years ago from Punjab.',
        'NewsArticles-3': 'BRICS wants to set up an alternative rating agency. Why it may not work\n\nMisheck Mutize, University of Cape Town and Sean Gossel, University of Cape Town The idea of establishing an alternative credit rating agency led by the BRICS bloc of countries is gaining momentum. But there are questions as to whether it will prosper given the major challenges it\'s bound to face. Leaders from the bloc made of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are championing the idea. The idea formerly emerged during the 2015 BRICS summit in Ufa and was affirmed by the Goa Declaration at the 8th BRICS Summit. Most recently South Africa\'s President Jacob Zuma said BRICS countries had taken the decision that they could rate themselves, and perhaps others too. The aim would be to ensure a more "balanced view" when ratings are made. Both Brazil and Russia have recently been downgraded by Moody\'s. And for over a year South Africa has lived with a possible downgrade by the "big three" Western credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor\'s, Moody\'s and Fitch. The big three have faced increasing criticism. Critics claim that the frequent downgrades of developing countries are unjust and serve Western political interests. BRICS has started engaging financial experts on a business model for the new rating agency as well as what methodology it would adopt. This isn\'t the first time there\'s been an attempt to challenge the big three. China, Russia, India and Brazil have all established their own credit rating agencies. But none has ever come close to establishing itself as an alternative. Will the BRICS initiative be the exception?   Critics of the big three were emboldened after the 2008 financial crisis. The rating agencies were forced to pay over $2.2 billion in fines relating to their complicity in the credit crisis. This further damaged their credibility and heightened accusations, particularly in emerging countries. Critics have also attacked the rating agencies\' issuer pay model. Under this system credit rating agencies are paid by the institutions being rated (debt issuers) and not by the investors who use the information, creating a conflict of interest. Critics also argue that this entrenches geopolitical biases. The hope is that a new agency would compensate for the perceived bias in the global financial architecture. It would also create competition and offer investors, issuers and other stakeholders a wider choice and a more diverse view on creditworthiness.   Given that BRICS is home to half the world\'s population, accounts for more than a quarter of the world\'s economic output and has recently set up a nascent New Development Bank, the countries under its banner have, between them, the capacity to establish an influential credit rating institution. But questions have been raised about whether the new rating agency satisfies a financial need or is politically motivated. And if it will be competent to provide an independent, objective and credible credit rating service based on sound methodology. China has already expressed concerns about the credibility of a new agency. Analysts have also strongly criticised the probable adoption of the existing "issuer-pay" model. This would mean that the current model is simply replicated.   Considering that the three major rating agencies control more than 90% of the world\'s ratings business, establishing a new one wouldn\'t be easy. It could take years, or even decades, to gel. There have been previous attempts to launch new ratings agencies. All failed to take off. Examples include the Lisbon headquartered ARC Ratings which was launched in November 2013 as a consortium of five national ratings agencies from South Africa, Malaysia, India, Brazil and Portugal. It is yet to release its first sovereign rating. The CARE Rating agency of India, started in April 1993, is still rating small to medium enterprises. The Global Credit Ratings (GCR) was established in South Africa in 1995. It is only planning to start offering sovereign credit ratings from 2017. Others that have been launched include: MARC of Malaysia which has been operational since 1996, but still only covers corporate ratings;   The Hong Kong based Universal Credit Rating Group which was launched in 2014l   Russia\'s Analytical Credit Rating Agency (ACRA) which was established in 2015;   the Beijing based China Chengxin Credit Rating Group, established in 1992;   and Dagong Global Credit Rating established in 1994. None has established itself as an alternative credit rating agency of choice for emerging countries.   The biggest task for a new BRICS credit rating agency will be to convince investors, particularly those from the US and Europe, that the ratings assigned are politically impartial. One way of doing this would be to adopt the "investor-pays" model where investors subscribe to ratings released by the agencies, and the subscription revenues become its source of income. This would ensure transparency and credibility while avoiding conflicts of interests. But adopting a new model might not fly given that main users of the credit rating information are global pension and mutual funds which currently use at least one of the "big three" rating agencies. They are therefore unlikely to trust any ratings from the new BRICS rating agency with a yet to be tested rating model. Adopting a new model would also be tricky as the BRICS rating agency would need to wield enough influence to be able to attract sufficient subscriptions from international funds. Finally, investors will be sceptical about the new BRICS rating agency\'s ability to compensate for losses in the event that it issues false ratings as the "big three" did in the US. The BRICS agency is likely to be another failed rating agency project unless it can overcome these three hurdles.

        'NewsArticles-4': 'Education Department Drops Web Site On Disabilities Act That Riled DeVos\n\nNew Education chief couldn\'t get behind federal civil rights law at confirmation hearings.\n\nA Department of Education web site explaining the rights of students under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act has vanished. That\'s the same law that confounded new Education Secretary Betsy De Vos during her confirmation hearings. DeVos dodged questioning about the law last month, insisting it was up to individual states on whether to grant disabled students their educational rights, even though it\'s a federal law that applies across the nation. New U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has also blasted the Disabilities Act for its "special treatment of certain children," blaming it for the-"Acceleration in the decline of civility and discipline in classrooms across America." A link to the the web site ceased working shortly before DeVos took office, the Seattle Post Intelligencer reported.- The Department of Education site now attributes the broken link-to "gechnical difficulties" and sends-people instead to the 159-page text of the very technical, complicated statute. The department site also lists available special education programs. The Disabilities Act information site that has now vanished was established under George W. Bush\'s administration as an aide for parents, students, teachers and school administrations to help them understand the rights of disabled students to an appropriate free public education under the law. The site was updated as modifications were passed and courts continued to interpret the law. Washington Democratic Senators Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray, who both voted against DeVos" confirmation, issued a statement Friday demanding to know why the information had been scrubbed. "the Department\'s failure to keep this critical resource operational makes it harder for parents, educators, and administrators to find the resources they need to implement this federal law and protect the rights of children with disabilities,"hey said. The Washington senators demanded -a "detailed timeline" of when the information was taken down, and when it will be restored. They also criticized Donald Trump for not being an "Advocate for disability rights [who]-famously mocked the physical disability of a New York Times reporter who asked him a question at a news conference" during his presidential campaign. During her confirmation hearings last month Sen. Tim Kaine (D.-Va.) quizzed DeVos on the law. DeVos responded that it was a "matter best left to the states." Kaine then asked: " some states might be good to kids with disabilities and other states might not be so good and, what then, people can just move around the country if they don"t like how kids are being treated?" DeVos again repeated that it\'s an issue "best left to the states," apparently unaware of how federal law works. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), who has a son with special needs,-clarified that the act is a federal civil rights law, adding: " do you stand by your statement a few minutes ago that it should be up to the state whether to follow it?" DeVos responded: "I may have confused it."Jeff Sessions spoke out against the law in 2000 from the Senate floor when he was representing Alabama. "We have created a complex system of federal regulations and laws that have created lawsuit after lawsuit, special treatment for certain children, and that are a big factor in accelerating the decline in civility and discipline in classrooms all over America. I say that very sincerely," Sessions said. Multi-billionaire Republican mega-donor DeVos was confirmed last Tuesday by a vote of 51-50. Her highly controversial confirmation required Vice President Mike Pence to vote to break a tie in the divided Senate. She has no experience in education and supports school vouchers and charter schools. She was blocked by protesters last week during her first visit to public school in Washington D.C. There has been no response to the web site changes from DeVos.'
