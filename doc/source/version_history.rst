Version history
===============

0.11.1 - 2022-02-10
-------------------

- show better error messages when dependencies for optional module ``corpus`` are not met
- fix a SciPy deprecation warning

0.11.0 - 2022-02-08
-------------------

This release brings several major API changes to the text loading, text preprocessing and text mining parts of
tmtoolkit. All these features are now in a single sub-module, ``corpus``. This module contains a ``Corpus`` class which
holds ``Document`` objects. All text processing and text mining operations can be performed on ``Corpus`` objects. These
operations are implemented as a functional API in the ``corpus`` sub-module.

It is advisable to re-install tmtoolkit in a new virtual environment following the
:ref:`installation instructions <install>`. Make sure to run ``python -m tmtoolkit setup <LANGUAGES>``, where
``<LANGUAGES>`` is a list of language codes like ``en,fr``.

Further changes include:

- added new functions for identifying and joining token collocations
- added new functions for visualizing corpus summary statistics
- added new function ``find_documents``
- added new text normalization functions ``normalize_unicode``, ``simplify_unicode``, ``numbers_to_magnitudes``
- added support for sentences
- added support for using all SpaCy token attributes
- added common ``select`` argument for many text processing/mining functions to operate only on a subset of documents
- added common ``as_table`` argument for many text processing/mining functions to operate to convert the result to a
  (sorted) dataframe
- added common ``proportions`` argument for many text processing/mining functions to convert resulting frequencies to
  proportions or log proportions
- added common ``inplace`` argument for many text processing/mining functions to either transform a corpus in-place or
  return a transformed copy
- added 6 new languages now supported by SpaCy (Catalan, Danish, Macedonian, Polish, Romanian, Russian)
- added new function ``corpus_join_documents`` for joining documents
- added option for calculating log probabilities or proportions
- fixed log probability calculations for higher precision in BoW statistics and topic model evaluation functions
- dependencies for text processing and text mining are now optional
- added function for easier logging: ``enable_logging``
- moved all functions that operate on string or numeric sequences to ``tokenseq`` sub-module
- all glob patterns now use ``EXACT`` flag
- added type annotations for ``corpus``, ``tokenseq`` and ``utils`` sub-modules
- updated dependencies (only SpaCy 3.2 or higher is now supported)
- updated minimum Python requirements (Python 3.8 or higher)
- removed datatable support


0.10.0 - 2020-08-03
-------------------

This release marks a switch from NLTK to `SpaCy <https://spacy.io/>`_ for text preprocessing tasks. With this change,
much more languages are supported (see `this list <https://spacy.io/models>`_). It is advisable to re-install tmtoolkit
in a new virtual environment following the :ref:`installation instructions <install>`. Make sure to run
``python -m tmtoolkit setup <LANGUAGES>``, where ``<LANGUAGES>`` is a list of language codes like ``en,fr``.

Further changes:

* added support for word and document vectors via SpaCy
* added built-in datasets available via ``Corpus`` class
* added ``ldamodel_top_word_topics`` and ``ldamodel_top_topic_docs`` functions
* added new filter functions and options for ``TMPreproc``
* made stemming function optional (only available when NLTK is installed)
* run DTM generation in parallel
* updated dependencies
* restructured tests
