    "The [topicmod module](api.rst#module-tmtoolkit.topicmod) offers a wide range of tools to facilitate [topic modeling](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/4/147361-probabilistic-topic-models/fulltext) with Python. This chapter will introduce the following techniques: \n",

    "A quick note on terminology: So far, we spoke about *tokens* or sometimes *terms* when we meant the individual elements that our documents consist of after we applied text preprocessing such as *tokenization* to the raw input text strings. These tokens can be lexicographically correct words, but they don't have to, e.g. when you applied stemming you might have tokens like \"argu\" in your vocabulary. There may also be numbers or punctuation symbols in your vocabulary. For many traditional topic modeling techniques, the results are usually two probability distributions: a *document-topic distribution* and a *topic-word distribution*. Since the latter is called topic-*word* and not topic-*token* or *-term* distribution, we will also use the term *word* when we mean any token from the corpus' vocabulary.\n",

Parallelization can be done per input DTM, per hyperparameter set and as combination of both. Hyperparameters control the number of topics and their \"granularity\". We will later have a look at the role of hyperparameters and how to find an optimal combination for a given dataset with the means of topic model evaluation.\n",

    "For now, we will concentrate on computing the topic models for both of our two DTMs in parallel. tmtoolkit supports three very popular packages for topic modeling, which provide the work of actually computing the model from the input matrix. They can all be accessed in separate sub-modules of the [topicmod module](api.rst#module-tmtoolkit.topicmod):\n",

    "- [topicmod.tm_lda](api.html#module-tmtoolkit.topicmod.tm_lda) provides an interface for the [lda](https://lda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package\n",
    "- [topicmod.tm_sklearn](api.html#module-tmtoolkit.topicmod.tm_sklearn) provides an interface for the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation.html) package\n",

    "Each of these sub-modules offer at least two functions that work with the respective package: `compute_models_parallel()` for general parallel model computation and `evaluate_topic_models()` for parallel model computation and evaluation (discussed later). For now, we want to compute two models in parallel with the [lda](https://lda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package and hence use [compute_models_parallel()](api.rst#tmtoolkit.topicmod.tm_lda.compute_models_parallel) from [topicmod.tm_lda](api.html#module-tmtoolkit.topicmod.tm_lda).\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to provide two things for this function: First, the input matrices as a dict that maps labels to the respective DTMs. Second, hyperparameters to use for the model computations. Note that each topic modeling package has different hyperparameters and you should refer to their documentation in order to find out, which hyperparameters you can provide. For lda, we set the number of topics `n_topics` to 10 and the number of iterations for the Gibbs sampling process `n_iter` to 1000. We always want to use the same hyperparameters, so we pass these as `constant_parameters`. If we wanted to create models for a whole range of parameters, e.g. for different numbers of topics, we could provide `varying_parameters`. We will check this out later when we evaluate topic models.\n",

Still, it's useful to give them labels for better identification. The function [generate_topic_labels_from_top_words()](api.rst#tmtoolkit.topicmod.model_stats.generate_topic_labels_from_top_words) is very useful for that, as it finds labels according to the most \"relevant\" words in each topic. We'll later see how we can identify the most relevant words per topic using a special [relevance statistic](#Topic-word-relevance). Note that you can adjust the weight of the relevance measure for the ranking by using the parameter `lambda_` which is in range $[0, 1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function requires at least the topic-word and document-topic distributions from the model, the document lengths and the vocabulary. It then finds the minimum number of relevant words that uniquely label each topic. You can also use a fixed number for that minimum number with the parameter `n_words`."

This is done by integrating a *lift* value, which is the *\"ratio of a term's probability within a topic to its marginal probability across the corpus.\"* (ibid.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus for each word $w$, given a topic-word distribution $\\phi$, a topic $t$ and a weight parameter $\\lambda$, it is calculated as:\n",

    "The first term $\\log \\phi_{t,w}$ is the log of the topic-word distribution, the second term $\\log \\frac{\\phi_{t,w}}{p(w)}$ is the *log lift* and $\\lambda$ can be used to control the weight between both terms. The lower $\\lambda$, the more weight is put on the lift term, i.e. the more different are the results from the original topic-word distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This measure is implemented in [topic_word_relevance()](api.rst#tmtoolkit.topicmod.model_stats.topic_word_relevance). It returns a matrix of the same shape as the topic-word distribution, i.e. each row represents a topic with a (log-transformed) distribution across all words in the vocabulary.
