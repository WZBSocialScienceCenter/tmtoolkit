    "The [topicmod module](api.rst#module-tmtoolkit.topicmod) offers a wide range of tools to facilitate [topic modeling](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/4/147361-probabilistic-topic-models/fulltext) with Python. This chapter will introduce the following techniques: \n",

    "A quick note on terminology: So far, we spoke about *tokens* or sometimes *terms* when we meant the individual elements that our documents consist of after we applied text preprocessing such as *tokenization* to the raw input text strings. These tokens can be lexicographically correct words, but they don't have to, e.g. when you applied stemming you might have tokens like \"argu\" in your vocabulary. There may also be numbers or punctuation symbols in your vocabulary. For many traditional topic modeling techniques, the results are usually two probability distributions: a *document-topic distribution* and a *topic-word distribution*. Since the latter is called topic-*word* and not topic-*token* or *-term* distribution, we will also use the term *word* when we mean any token from the corpus' vocabulary.\n",

We will later have a look at the role of hyperparameters and how to find an optimal combination for a given dataset with the means of topic model evaluation.\n",

They can all be accessed in separate sub-modules of the [topicmod module](api.rst#module-tmtoolkit.topicmod):\n",

For now, we want to compute two models in parallel with the [lda](https://lda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package and hence use [compute_models_parallel()](api.rst#tmtoolkit.topicmod.tm_lda.compute_models_parallel) from [topicmod.tm_lda](api.html#module-tmtoolkit.topicmod.tm_lda).\n",

    "We need to provide two things for this function: First, the input matrices as a dict that maps labels to the respective DTMs. Second, hyperparameters to use for the model computations. Note that each topic modeling package has different hyperparameters and you should refer to their documentation in order to find out, which hyperparameters you can provide. For lda, we set the number of topics `n_topics` to 10 and the number of iterations for the Gibbs sampling process `n_iter` to 1000. We always want to use the same hyperparameters, so we pass these as `constant_parameters`. If we wanted to create models for a whole range of parameters, e.g. for different numbers of topics, we could provide `varying_parameters`. We will check this out later when we evaluate topic models.\n",

    "tmtoolkit provides several metrics for comparing and evaluating topic models. This can be used for finding a good hyperparameter set for a given dataset, e.g. a good combination of the number of topics and concentration paramaters (often called alpha and beta in literature). For some background on hyperparameters in topic modeling, see [this blog post](https://datascience.blog.wzb.eu/2017/11/09/topic-modeling-evaluation-in-python-with-tmtoolkit/).\n",

We make the concentration parameter for a prior over the document-specific topic distributions, alpha, depending on `k` as `1/k`:"

However, it doesn't only compute the models in parallel, but also applies several metrics to these models in order to evaluate them.

These metrics refer to functions that are implemented in [topicmod.evaluate](api.rst#module-tmtoolkit.topicmod.evaluate).\n",

    "In topic modeling, topics are numbered because they're *abstract* – they're simply a probability distribution across all words in the vocabulary. Still, it's useful to give them labels for better identification. The function [generate_topic_labels_from_top_words()](api.rst#tmtoolkit.topicmod.model_stats.generate_topic_labels_from_top_words) is very useful for that, as it finds labels according to the most \"relevant\" words in each topic. We'll later see how we can identify the most relevant words per topic using a special relevancy statistic. Note that you can adjust the weight of the relevancy measure for the ranking by using the parameter `lambda_` which is in range $[0, 1]$.\n",
