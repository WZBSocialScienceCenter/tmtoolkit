tmtookit: Text mining and topic modeling toolkit
================================================

|pypi| |pypi_downloads| |rtd| |travis| |coverage| |zenodo|

*tmtoolkit* is a set of tools for text mining and topic modeling with Python developed especially for the use in the
social sciences. It aims for easy installation, extensive documentation and a clear programming interface while
offering good performance on large datasets by the means of vectorized operations (via NumPy) and parallel computation
(using Python's *multiprocessing* module). It combines several known and well-tested packages such as
`NLTK <http://www.nltk.org/>`_ or `SciPy <https://scipy.org/>`_.

At the moment, tmtoolkit focuses on methods around the *Bag-of-words* model, but word embeddings may be integrated in
the future.

The documentation for tmtoolkit is available on `tmtoolkit.readthedocs.org <https://tmtoolkit.readthedocs.org>`_ and
the GitHub code repository is on
`github.com/WZBSocialScienceCenter/tmtoolkit <https://github.com/WZBSocialScienceCenter/tmtoolkit>`_.

Features
--------

Text preprocessing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

tmtoolkit implements or provides convenient wrappers for several preprocessing methods, including:

* `tokenization <preprocessing.ipynb#Tokenization>`_
* `part-of-speech (POS) tagging <preprocessing.ipynb#Part-of-speech-(POS)-tagging>`_
* `lemmatization and stemming <preprocessing.ipynb#Stemming-and-lemmatization>`_
* extensive `token normalization / cleaning methods <preprocessing.ipynb#Token-normalization>`_
* extensive `pattern matching capabilities <preprocessing.ipynb#Common-parameters-for-pattern-matching-functions>`_
  (exact matching, regular expressions or "glob" patterns) to be used in many
  methods of the package, e.g. for filtering on token, document or document label level, or for keywords-in-context
  (KWIC)
* generating `n-grams <preprocessing.ipynb#Generating-n-grams>`_
* generating `sparse document-term matrices <preprocessing.ipynb#Generating-a-sparse-document-term-matrix-(DTM)>`_
* management of `token metadata <preprocessing.ipynb#Working-with-token-metadata-/-POS-tagging>`_
* `expanding compound words and "gluing" of specified subsequent tokens
  <preprocessing.ipynb#Expanding-compound-words-and-joining-tokens>`_, e.g. ``["White", "House"]`` becomes
  ``["White_House"]``

All text preprocessing methods can operate in parallel to speed up computations with large datasets.

Topic modeling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `model computation in parallel <topic_modeling.ipynb#Computing-topic-models-in-parallel>`_ for different copora
  and/or parameter sets
* support for `lda <http://pythonhosted.org/lda/>`_,
  `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation.html>`_
  and `gensim <https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/>`_ topic modeling backends
* `evaluation of topic models <topic_modeling.ipynb#Evaluation-of-topic-models>`_ (e.g. in order to an optimal number
  of topics for a given dataset) using several implemented metrics:

   * model coherence (`Mimno et al. 2011 <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2145462>`_) or with
     `metrics implemented in Gensim <https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/coherencemodel.html>`_)
   * KL divergence method (`Arun et al. 2010 <http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-13657-3_43>`_)
   * probability of held-out documents (`Wallach et al. 2009 <https://doi.org/10.1145/1553374.1553515>`_)
   * pair-wise cosine distance method (`Cao Juan et al. 2009 <http://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2008.06.011>`_)
   * harmonic mean method (`Griffiths, Steyvers 2004 <http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0307752101>`_)
   * the loglikelihood or perplexity methods natively implemented in lda, sklearn or gensim

* `plotting of evaluation results <topic_modeling.ipynb#Evaluation-of-topic-models>`_
* `common statistics for topic models <topic_modeling.ipynb#Common-statistics-and-tools-for-topic-models>`_ such as
  word saliency and distinctiveness (`Chuang et al. 2012 <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2254572>`_), topic-word
  relevance (`Sievert and Shirley 2014 <https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-3110>`_)
* `finding / filtering topics with pattern matching <topic_modeling.ipynb#Filtering-topics>`_
* `export estimated document-topic and topic-word distributions to Excel
  <topic_modeling.ipynb#Displaying-and-exporting-topic-modeling-results>`_
* `visualize topic-word distributions and document-topic distributions <topic_modeling.ipynb#Visualizing-topic-models>`_
  as word clouds or heatmaps
* coherence for individual topics
* integrate `PyLDAVis <https://pyldavis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to visualize results


Other features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `loading and cleaning of raw text from text files, tabular files (CSV or Excel), ZIP files or folders
  <text_corpora.ipynb>`_
* `common statistics and transformations for document-term matrices <bow.ipynb>`_ like word cooccurrence and *tf-idf*


Limits
------

* currently only German and English language texts are supported for language-dependent text preprocessing methods
  such as POS tagging or lemmatization
* all data must reside in memory, i.e. no streaming of large data from the hard disk (which for example
  `Gensim <https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/>`_ supports)
* no direct support of word embeddings


Built-in datasets
-----------------

Currently tmtoolkit comes with the following built-in datasets which can be loaded via
:meth:`tmtoolkit.corpus.Corpus.from_builtin_corpus`:

* ``'english-NewsArticles'``: dai, tianru, 2017, "News Articles", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GMFCTR, Harvard Dataverse,
  V1
* ``'german-bt18_speeches_sample'``: Random sample of speeches from the 18th German Bundestag;
  https://github.com/Datenschule/offenesparlament-data


About this documentation
------------------------

This documentation guides you in several chapters from installing tmtoolkit to its specific use cases and shows some
examples with built-in corpora and other datasets. All "hands on" chapters from `Getting started <getting_started.ipynb>`_
to `Topic modeling <topic_modeling.ipynb>`_ are generated from `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_. If you want
to follow along using these notebooks, you can
`download them from the GitHub repository <https://github.com/WZBSocialScienceCenter/tmtoolkit/tree/master/doc/source>`_.

There are also a few other examples as plain Python scripts available in the
`examples folder <https://github.com/WZBSocialScienceCenter/tmtoolkit/tree/master/examples>`_ of the GitHub repository.
